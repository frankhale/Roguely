# Roguely

![Roguely Logo](assets/roguely-logo.png)

Roguely is a very simple Roguelike in SDL/C++/Lua.

The game is using very simple cellular automata algorithm to generate maps.
Each time you run the game you'll get a new map. Enemies spawn, move around
randomly and you can attack them to increase your score. You can pick up health
gems and coins. Dead enemies can spawn a treasure chests which increase score.
Look for the golden candle and if you collect it you will win the game.

There is no real point to the game. It was a fun exercise to create an engine
and integrate Lua into it.

## Building

This code uses `vcpkg` and for dependencies management and `cmake` to build.

You can get `vckpg` here: [https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg)

Roguely has the following dependencies which are managed by `vcpkg`:

In order to build you must install these dependencies:

- SDL2
- SDL_image
- SDL_mixer (with mpg123 support)
- SDL_ttf
- Lua
- Sol2
- Boost
- magic_enum
- fmt

You may want to have a look at the CMakePresets.json file to see if it needs 
updating, specifically the location of `vcpkg`.

## How to use the game engine

This engine provides a simple Entity Component System and exposes that to Lua.
Since this engine uses SDL2 it also exposes several SDL2 functions to Lua to
make creating grid turn based games easier. The engines primary design is to
make creating grid turn based games easier.

The engine expects that the `roguely.lua` file will have a global table called
`Game` which at the least defines the following properties:

```lua
Game = {
  window_title = "Roguely (2023 Edition) - A simple Roguelike in C++/Lua/SDL2",
  window_icon_path = "assets/icon.png",
  window_width = 1280,
  window_height = 640,
  map_width = 100,
  map_height = 100,
  spritesheet_name = "roguely-x",
  spritesheet_path = "assets/roguely-x.png",
  spritesheet_sprite_width = 8,
  spritesheet_sprite_height = 8,
  spritesheet_sprite_scale_factor = 4,
  font_path = "assets/NESCyrillic.ttf",
  soundtrack_path = "assets/ExitExitProper.mp3",
  logo_image_path = "assets/roguely-logo.png",
  start_game_image_path = "assets/press-space-bar-to-play.png",
  credit_image_path = "assets/credits.png",
  sounds = {
      coin = "assets/sounds/coin.wav",
      bump = "assets/sounds/bump.wav",
      combat = "assets/sounds/combat.wav",
      death = "assets/sounds/death.wav",
      pickup = "assets/sounds/pickup.wav",
      warp = "assets/sounds/warp.wav",
      walk = "assets/sounds/walk.wav"
  },
  entities = {
    player = {
      components = {
          sprite_component = {
              name = "player",
              spritesheet_name = "roguely-x",
              sprite_id = 15,
              blink = false,
              render = function(self, game, player, dx, dy, scale_factor)
                  -- handle sprite player render here
              end
          },
          position_component = { x = 0, y = 0 },
          stats_component = {
              max_health = 50,
              health = 50,
              health_recovery = 10,
              attack = 5,
              crit_chance = 2,
              crit_multiplier = 2,
              score = 0,
              kills = 0,
              level = 0,
              experience = 0,
          },
          healthbar_component = {
            -- handle render of health bar
          },
          tick_component = {
            -- handle what occurs during a game tick (every one second)
          }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

When games are started up the engine first looks to make sure required
properties are in the `Game` table and then it calls `_init()`. This function
can be used to setup your game. You can spawn entities, set up your maps, etc...

It's expected that during the intialization you will add various system
functions that will be called in order to handle game entities.

For instance:

```lua
add_system("render_system", render_system)
add_system("keyboard_input_system", keyboard_input_system)
add_system("combat_system", combat_system)
add_system("leveling_system", leveling_system)
add_system("loot system", loot_system)
add_system("tick_system", tick_system)
add_system("mob_movement_system", mob_movement_system)
```

Systems are just functions that look like:

```lua
function keyboard_input_system(key, player, entities, entities_in_viewport)
end
```

Have a look at `roguely.lua` to see how more about how to use the engine.
